            <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named
                after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of
                the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.
                The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated
                over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which
                is about one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon,
                Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems
                formed by impact event remnants.</p>

            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size
                to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets,
                composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has
                a mean temperature of 737 K (464 ¬∞C; 867 ¬∞F) and a pressure 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These
                extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state at Venus's surface.
                Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced
                magnetosphere is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. Internal heat escapes through
                active volcanism,[21][22] resulting in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two
                planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, that have no moons.[23] Conditions perhaps
                favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers.</p>

            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.[23] This is
                enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.
                Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The
                remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses
                within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by
                vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's
                groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving
                tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a
                liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar
                winds and cosmic radiation.</p>

            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in
                iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest
                objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for
                telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar
                System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day
                (sol) is equal to 24.6 hours, and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days).
                Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.
                The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in
                southern highlands this terrain observation is known as the Martian dichotomy. Mars hosts many
                enormous extinct volcanoes (the tallest is Olympus Mons, 21.9 km or 13.6 mi tall) and one of the largest
                canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km or 2,500 mi long). Geologically, the planet is
                fairly active with marsquakes trembling underneath the ground, dust devils sweeping across the
                landscape, and cirrus clouds. Carbon dioxide is substantially present in Mars's polar ice caps and thin
                atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a
                mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less
                than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth, and a tenth that of
                the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86
                years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and
                has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of
                ancient Roman religion.Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration
                during the primordial phase
                of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere
                consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior. It contains trace elements and
                compounds like carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon, ammonia, water vapour, phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, and
                hydrocarbons. Jupiter's helium abundance is 80% of the Sun's, similar to Saturn's composition. </p>

            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is
                a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the
                average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is almost as
                big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU
                (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.
                Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic
                hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn
                has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the
                metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker
                than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size.
                Saturn's magnetic field strength is about a twentieth that of Jupiter.[32] </p>

            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is
                made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or
                volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum
                temperature (49 K ( 224 ¬∞C; 371 ¬∞F)) of all the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of
                82.23¬∞ with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year
                orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42
                years of continuous darkness. Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the
                Solar System's planets. Based on
                current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen
                and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon
                monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in
                the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its
                peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),[23] variations in its polar cap, and its erratic cloud formation.
                The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, the cause of which remains
                unclear.</p>

            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the
                Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times
                the mass of Earth. Compared to its fellow ice giant Uranus, Neptune is slightly more massive, but denser
                and smaller. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids,[21] it has no well-defined solid surface,
                and orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion
                kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical
                symbol ‚ôÜ, representing Neptune's trident.[e] Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was not
                initially observed by direct empirical observation. Rather, unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus
                led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown
                planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was mathematically predicted from his
                observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently
                directly observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[2] by Johann Gottfried Galle within a degree of
                the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter,
                though none of the planet's remaining moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. </p>
